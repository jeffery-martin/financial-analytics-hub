## ðŸš€ Revenue Metrics

### MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
```DAX
Total MRR = SUM(subscriptions[monthly_price])
```

    subscriptions[monthly_price] * 12
)
```

## ðŸ‘¤ Customer Metrics

### Active Customers
```DAX
Active Customers =

    DISTINCTCOUNT(subscriptions[customer_id]),
    ISBLANK(subscriptions[end_date]) || subscriptions[end_date] > TODAY()
)
```

### Churned Customers
```DAX
Churned Customers = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(subscriptions[customer_id]),
    NOT(ISBLANK(subscriptions[end_date])) && subscriptions[end_date] < TODAY()
)
```

### Churn Rate
```DAX
Churn Rate = 
DIVIDE([Churned Customers], [Active Customers] + [Churned Customers])
```

---

## ðŸ’° CAC & LTV

### Average CAC
```DAX
Average CAC = AVERAGE(customers[acquisition_cost])
```

Average LTV = AVERAGEX(
    subscriptions,
    subscriptions[monthly_price] * subscriptions[seats] * 36
)
```

### LTV to CAC Ratio
```DAX
LTV to CAC Ratio = DIVIDE([Average LTV], [Average CAC])
```

Expansion MRR = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(subscriptions[monthly_price]),
    subscriptions[subscription_type] = "seat_expansion"

```

---

## ðŸ§  Retention

### Average Subscription Length (in months)
